# Contributing

Open GitHub issues for bugs, feature requests etc.

Pull requests are welcome; please follow the guidelines below:

- Submit all pull-requests to the develop branch.
- Small pull-requests are far more likely to be accepted than large ones.
- Commit early, commit often. Each commit should represent a single, atomic change. Keep commits small.
- Each corresponding change should have an associated test to go along
with it.  If you are having trouble testing, open an issue to discuss
it.
- Before starting on a significant addition, open an issue so we can discuss how it impacts the project.
